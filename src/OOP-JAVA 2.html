<h1>Object-oriented programming (OOP) Cont..</h1>
<p>On the previous page we learned about what OOP and the two main concepts classes and objects.<br>
Now let's take a look at the 4 pillars of object oriented programming. </p>

<h4>Encapsulation</h4>
<p> Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.<br>
    It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.<br>
    Another way to think about encapsulation is, <br>
    it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.</p>

<h4>Abstraction</h4>
<p>Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.<br>
    The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user.
    <br>Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.<br>
    Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details.
    <br>The properties and behaviours of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.</p>
<h4> Inheritance</h4>
<p>Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming).<br>
    It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.<br>
    The Syntax is: <br>
    class derived-class extends base-class{<br>
    //methods and fields}<br>
</p>
<h4>Polymorphism</h4>
<p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. <br>
    The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.<br>
    Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.<br></p>
